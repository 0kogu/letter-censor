# Word Transformer
A Flask-based web application that allows users to input a list of words and transforms them by replacing certain characters with underscores. The transformed words can be used for simple word puzzles or as a fun way to obfuscate text.

## Features
* Text Transformation: Replace specific characters in words with underscores to create word puzzles.
* User-Friendly Interface: Responsive and interactive UI built with Flask templates, HTML, and CSS.
* Server-Side Processing: Flask handles form submissions, processes input text, and dynamically renders transformed text.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7+
* Flask: Install Flask using pip if it's not already installed.

## Usage
Input Text: Enter a list of words into the input text area. Each word should be on a new line.

Transform Words: Click the "Transform Words" button to generate the transformed words with underscores replacing some characters.

## Example
### Before Transformation:

```

difficult
computer
smartphone
outside

```

### After Transformation:

```

d_ff___lt
c_mp_te_
sma__p_o_e
o_t_id_

```
